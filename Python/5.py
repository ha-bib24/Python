+ This is plus operator
- this is minus op[erator
* This is multiple operator
/ this is divided operator
% this is modulus operator
// This is floor operator
** This is exponential operator

print(a - b)
print(a * b)
print(a / b)
print(a % b)
print(a ** b) # Exponential operator
print(a // b) # floor operator
